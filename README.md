## Overview
This project predicts the **intensity** (happiness, angriness, sadness) in text reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Contains the input datasets.
- `app/`: Source code for preprocessing, feature engineering and training.
- `model/`: Stores the trained models and TF-IDF vectorizer.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists required Python libraries.
- `experiment.ipynb`: Experimentation with different models

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
